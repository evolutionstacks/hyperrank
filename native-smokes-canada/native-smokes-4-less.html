<ol>
<li><strong>Start Slow:</strong> If you're new to  Native-made cigarettes, take it slow  to get used to the flavor . Native Smokes Canada  delivers a unique, natural taste compared to conventional options, so it may take a bit of time to adjust . Begin with shorter sessions  and gradually increase as you become more comfortable . This approach helps you  avoid any overwhelming sensations and fully experience  the  smoothness of our premium leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Smoking can cause dehydration , so drink plenty of water  throughout the day. Staying well-hydrated not only supports your overall health  but also  helps you avoid any discomfort. Drinking fluids like  refreshing beverages can also  refresh your senses between smokes, allowing you to  fully appreciate the distinctive flavors  of our tobacco. Pro Tip: Carry a water bottle with you  for easy access whenever you  enjoy a cigarette.</li>
<li><strong>Respect Public Spaces:</strong> Be aware of  public smoking regulations in your area to  be considerate of others. Many cities and towns have  designated areas for smoking, and it's important  to follow these guidelines. Not only does this  contribute to a cleaner environment, but it also keeps you compliant with local laws . Always check for signs  and be discreet  when in public settings. If you're unsure, it&rsquo;s best to ask  before you light up.</li>
